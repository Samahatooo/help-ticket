## ⚙️ How It Works

- Each row in the tracker represents a single support request.

- The **Status** and **Resolution Date** columns are used to calculate **Resolution Time**, or display "Pending" if unresolved.
- The **Open tickets** column (J) counts ongoing tickets per technician or user for workload management.
- The spreadsheet is formatted with filterable headers, allowing the user to quickly sort or search by any column (e.g., by Priority, Technician, or Status).
